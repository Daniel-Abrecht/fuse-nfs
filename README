fuse-nfs
========

This is a fuse module that implements the NFSv3 protocol.

Building
========

$ sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev libnfs1
$ ./setup.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

ROOT vs NON-ROOT
================
By default, most NFS servers will only allow access from clients that are
using a system port (i.e. a port < 1024).
Since these ports by default can only be used by the root user this will
prevent non-root users from conencting to the NFS server or mounting the
filesystem.

There are two ways to solve this:
1, cap_net_bind_service
-----------------------
On Linux, when this capability is set the kernel will allow that program
to use system ports for any user that runs that program.

  sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./fuse/fuse-nfs

Setting this capability will allow normal non-root users to access the NFS
server.

2, insecure
-----------
Alternatively you can often disable the "chack that the client connects from
a system port" in the NFS server itself.
On Linux NFS servers this is done by adding the "insecure" keyword to
the /etc/exports file.


URL-FORMAT:
===========
Libnfs uses RFC2224 style URLs extended with libnfs specific url arguments some minor extensions.
The basic syntax of these URLs is :

nfs://<server|ipv4|ipv6>/path[?arg=val[&arg=val]*]

Arguments supported by libnfs are :
 tcp-syncnt=<int>  : Number of SYNs to send during the session establish
                     before failing setting up the tcp connection to the
                     server.
 uid=<int>         : UID value to use when talking to the server.
                     default it 65534 on Windows and getuid() on unixen.
 gid=<int>         : GID value to use when talking to the server.
                     default it 65534 on Windows and getgid() on unixen.
 readahead=<int>   : Enable readahead for files and set the maximum amount
                     of readahead to <int>.
 auto-traverse-mounts=<0|1>
                   : Should libnfs try to traverse across nested mounts
		     automatically or not. Default is 1 == enabled.


To mount a filesystem:
======================
fuse-nfs -n nfs://127.0.0.1/data/tmp -m /my/mountpoint


To unmount a filesystem:
========================
fusermount -u /my/mountpoint
